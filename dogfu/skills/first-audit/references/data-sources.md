# Data sources (`dogfu` CLI)

Every call here is a **read-only** lookup against the Agent Berlin backend via the `dogfu`
CLI. Run any command from anywhere on your PATH once the dogfu MCP's `get_setup_instructions`
flow has installed and configured the CLI:

```bash
dogfu <group> <cmd> [flags]
```

JSON to stdout by default. Discover exact flags with `dogfu <group> <cmd> --help`.

**Golden rule:** these responses are large and metered. In every step, fetch once with
`dogfu … -o <run-dir>/<name>.json`, print a short summary, and do all later analysis from
the file. Budget a generous timeout per call (the first call after an idle period can take
a minute or two; warm calls are a few seconds). Never fetch the same thing twice.

The groups this skill uses: **`seo`** (keyword/competitor/traffic/technical, **backlinks, and the
LLM-Mentions AEO index**), **`google`**
(Google web + AI Mode), and **`chatgpt`** (the ChatGPT answer surface). The crawl/on-page
layer is the **Bluesnake MCP**, documented separately in `bluesnake.md`.

## seo

Works for any domain — no ownership needed. Cap `--limit`, use `--order-by` / `--filters`.
Market is set with `--location-code` (numeric) and `--language-code` (two-letter) — see
[Localization](#localization).

* **`seo ranked-keywords --target <domain>`** `[--location-code N] [--language-code xx] [--limit 100] [--offset] [--order-by "keyword_data.keyword_info.search_volume,desc"] [--filters JSON]` — keywords a domain ranks for: `keyword, search_volume, cpc, competition, competition_level, rank, rank_group, url, title, intent, etv`. Run for the **prospect and each competitor**.
* **`seo keyword-ideas --keyword "<seed>"...`** `[--location-code] [--language-code] [--limit] [--order-by]` — expand your Phase B seeds into related ideas: `keyword, search_volume, cpc, competition, competition_level, difficulty` → opportunity gaps.
* **`seo domain-overview --target <domain>`** `[--location-code] [--language-code]` — organic snapshot: `organic{count (≈ ranking-keyword count), etv (traffic value), paid_traffic_cost, is_new/up/down/lost}, paid{}`.
* **`seo bulk-traffic-estimation --target <a>... --target <b>...`** `[--location-code] [--language-code] [--item-type organic ..]` — estimate traffic for up to 1,000 domains in one call → the head-to-head benchmark. Per target: `organic{count, etv}, paid`.
* **`seo relevant-pages --target <domain>`** `[--location-code] [--language-code] [--limit] [--order-by "metrics.organic.etv,desc"]` — the domain's top pages by organic traffic: `page_address, organic{count, etv, pos_*}, paid`.
* **`seo historical-rank-overview --target <domain>`** `[--location-code] [--language-code] [--date-from YYYY-MM-DD] [--date-to ..]` — monthly time series (momentum): `RankHistoryPoint[]` with `year, month, organic{count, etv, pos_1, pos_2_3, pos_4_10, pos_11_plus, ...}, paid`.
* **`seo technologies --target <domain>`** — CMS / analytics / framework stack + contact signals: `domain_rank` (**a large DataForSEO-style integer, NOT a 0–100 score — use only as a coarse, relative signal** between target and competitors), `last_visited, country_iso_code, emails[], phone_numbers[], social_graph_urls[], technologies{category:{subcategory:[...]}}`.
* **`seo lighthouse --url <url>`** `[--strategy mobile|desktop] [--locale en-US]` — Lighthouse / PageSpeed audit (this is the Core Web Vitals source): `performance_score, accessibility_score, seo_score, best_practices_score` (0–1, ×100 to show), `core_web_vitals{lcp_ms, fcp_ms, cls, tbt_ms, ...}`, real-user `field_data` (CrUX — **the signal Google actually ranks on; absent/None for low-traffic sites**, fall back to lab `core_web_vitals`), `opportunities[]`, `diagnostics[]`. Run **mobile and desktop separately** (two calls) on the key URL(s) — usually the homepage and a top landing page. Each call blocks ~10–90s.

### Backlinks — off-domain authority (cheap)

Feeds the **Authority** scorecard dimension with real numbers instead of the ambiguous
`technologies.domain_rank`. All take `--target <domain>`, are **global** (no `--location-code`),
and are **cheap** — ~$0.02/call ($0.02/request + $0.00003/row, ≤1,000 rows). Confirm exact
flags/fields with `--help` (these commands are new).

* **`seo backlinks-summary --target <domain>`** — the aggregate authority profile in one row: total `backlinks`, `referring_domains`, `backlink_rank` (a DataForSEO-style integer — **relative only**: compare target vs competitors, never read as an absolute grade), `spam_score`, and the link-mix distributions (dofollow/nofollow, anchor, referring-TLD). Run for the **prospect and each competitor** — this is the head-to-head authority bar. ~$0.02 each.
* **`seo referring-domains --target <domain>`** `[--limit] [--order-by] [--filters]` — one row per linking domain: the domain, `backlinks` from it, `rank`, `spam_score`. Pull for the **prospect only**, capped (`--limit 100`, order by rank desc) → the "who links to them" list + a spam-share read.
* **`seo backlinks --target <domain>`** (individual backlinks: source page, anchor, dofollow, rank) and **`seo backlink-competitors --target <domain>`** (domains sharing the target's link profile, by overlap) — **usually skip both** for a first audit; `backlinks-summary` + `referring-domains` give the report all it needs. Only reach for these if a specific claim needs row-level detail.

### LLM Mentions — the AEO index (evaluate before you trust it)

A **pre-indexed** database of AI answers: where a brand/keyword *already* shows up in
**ChatGPT (US-only, GPT-5)** and **Google AI Overview (all locations)**. It is the
*deterministic, aggregate-across-many-keywords* complement to the live synthetic queries
(`google ai-mode` / `chatgpt search`) — **not a replacement**. It is **keyword-indexed**, so a
niche or non-US brand can return near-zero simply because its terms aren't tracked, and you
**cannot tell "invisible in AI" from "not in the index."** **Cost ~$0.10–0.25/call**
($0.10/request + $0.001/row) — roughly 5–10× a SERP/AI-mode call. Because of the cost and the
coverage gaps it is **gated on the Phase D real-vs-synthetic check** — pull it, then keep it in
the report only if it genuinely adds signal for that brand. Each command takes repeatable
`--keyword` and/or `--domain` plus optional `--platform google|chat_gpt`. Confirm exact
flags/fields with `--help` (new commands).

* **`seo mentions-summary --domain <domain>`** — the brand's aggregate AI-visibility profile: total mentions + breakdowns by platform, cited source, brand, location, language. Run for the **prospect and each competitor** → index-wide share-of-voice.
* **`seo mentions-top-domains --keyword "<seed>"...`** / **`seo mentions-top-pages --keyword "<seed>"...`** — the domains / pages most cited in AI answers for your seed keywords (who's surfaced instead of the prospect) → broadens the "most-cited third-party sources" read beyond your ~10 live queries.
* **`seo mentions-search --keyword "<seed>"...`** — the raw records behind the aggregates: the question, the answer, the cited (and non-cited) sources, AI search volume. Use sparingly — to spot-check a surprising aggregate.

***

## google

SERP feature fields default to empty/None when Google doesn't return them, so guard with
`if features.get("ai_overview"):` etc.

* **`google search --query "<q>"`** `[--country us] [--language en] [--location "City,Region,Country"] [--max-results 1-100]` → `query, total_results` (Google's "About N results" estimate — what `site:` queries read; nullable), `results[]` (title, url, snippet, displayed_link, position), and a **`features{}`** dict carrying `answer_box`, `related_questions` (People Also Ask), `knowledge_graph`, `ai_overview` (the inline AI Overview block when Google returns one), `related_searches`, `local_results`, etc.
* **`google ai-mode --query "<q>"`** `[--country] [--language] [--location]` → `query, answer` (markdown — the primary signal) + `citations[]` (title, url, source, snippet). This is Google's dedicated AI Mode.

**There is no separate `ai-overview` command** — the inline AI Overview rides in the
`features.ai_overview` field of `google search`. For the conversational AI surface use
`google ai-mode`.

**AEO use:** run seeds through `google search` (read `features.ai_overview` /
`features.answer_box` / `features.related_questions`); run conversational variants through
`google ai-mode`. For each, check brand & competitor presence and collect cited domains.

***

## chatgpt

* **`chatgpt search --query "<q>"`** `[--model gpt-5.4-mini] [--search-context-size low|medium|high] [--domain-filter <d>...] [--reasoning-effort ..] [--city/--region/--user-country/--timezone ..]` → `query, model, answer, citations[]` (title, url, snippet), `usage{tokens}`. **This is the "ask ChatGPT" surface** for the AEO test — the right tool because you're explicitly asking what AI assistants answer.
  * **Model:** use `gpt-5.4-mini` (the default). The other accepted values are `gpt-5.5` and `gpt-5.4-nano`. We are not using Gemini or Perplexity here.
  * Set `--user-country` (and `--city`/`--region`/`--timezone` if relevant) to match the brand's geo — see [Localization](#localization).
  * Check whether the prospect / competitor domains appear in `citations`, and tally cited domains across all queries.

***

## Localization

Derive geo from the brand brief (`brand-brief.md`). If the brand serves one dominant
geography, set it consistently on **every** geo-aware call: `seo` `--location-code` /
`--language-code`, `google` `--country` / `--language` / `--location`, `chatgpt`
`--user-country`. If the brand is global / multi-region, default to US/English
(`--location-code 2840` / `--language-code en`, `--country us`) and say so. Keep one geo
decision for the whole audit so numbers are comparable.

Common market codes (`--location-code` is DataForSEO numeric; `--language-code` is
two-letter): US `2840`, UK `2826`, Canada `2124`, Australia `2036`, Germany `2276`,
France `2250`, Poland `2616`, Netherlands `2528`, India `2356`, Singapore `2702`.
Languages: `en, de, fr, pl, nl, es`. `google` also accepts `--country` (ISO alpha-2 like
`us`, `de`) and `--location` (a canonical string like `"Austin,Texas,United States"`).

## What `dogfu` does NOT cover

The `dogfu` CLI exposes only the groups above for data (its other groups serve the
sales-pipeline skills, not this audit). For this audit that means:

* **No Bing / Trends / Reddit / Maps / backlink-marketplace commands.** If a report section genuinely needs one of these (e.g. a Reddit citation gap, local reviews), reach for your own **WebSearch / web-fetch tools** — don't invent a `dogfu` command for it. Keep it to what the report will actually use.
* **No brand-profile or report-publish under "data"** — brand context is a local file you build (`brand-brief.md`, see `SKILL.md`), and publishing is `dogfu report publish` (see `report.md`).
